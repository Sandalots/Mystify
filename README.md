# Mystify Original
On-site, localised password keeper and password encryption without extruding data elsewhere without third party interference. 

## Abstract
Localised password encrypter and manager. Serves the console, desktop and web all asynchronously and interconnectly.

## Installation
Clone this repo. Navigate to the Even8 cloned dir. Permutate main.py with python main.py [ARGS] (Node or Gateway).
Further, an ARG clear is included for obvious reasons, to clear the dataset.

## Usage
Run '''main.py''' with args gateway or node. Proceed to follow console or GUI instructions. Navigate to localhost:3000 for web interfacing. Customise using config.yaml.

## State 
The current state of Mystify is quite dodgy. With it being strung together by weak strings of interal abstractions that need rewritten and cut down. And better implemented.
